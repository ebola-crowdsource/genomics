# WIP - Analysis of Ebola virus genome Crowdsourcing #

In this wiki we aim to gather all the results of the analysis of the Ebola virus strains responsible for recent outbreaks in 2014.  We also want to compare the new outbreak genome sequencing to genomes isolated from other mammals and previous human outbreaks.  Please add your name to the repo!

This wiki has been inspired by previous crowdsourcing efforts (*E*. *coli* o104 outbreak, etc.).  There is no goal at the moment except to explore what can be done to help stop the outbreak.

Feel free to add data or analyses, and please feel free to edit the wiki. You just need a GitHub account to do so.  If you want to submit your data, read this: [[how to contribute]].  There is no goal for this repo at the moment except to help curb the outbreak and to understand the epidemiology of the disease.
